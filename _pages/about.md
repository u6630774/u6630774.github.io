I'm a graduate student from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/), pursuing a Master of Arts in Economics (Expected: Dec 2024). 
My research interests include economic modeling, machine learning in asset pricing, econometrics, and development economics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Denis Simon](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/denis.simon) at Duke University. 
Previously, I was advised by [Dr. Zongwu Cai](https://people.ku.edu/~zongwu/) at the University of Kansas.

You can find my CV here: [Yurou Gao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
